Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal
diary became a centerpiece in the construction of a modern
subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason
and critique to the understanding of world and self, which
allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were
central media through which enlightened and free subjects
could be constructed. They provided a space where one could
write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts.
Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and
happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives
about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It
is in that context that the idea of ¡°the self [as] both made and
explored with words¡± emerges. Diaries were personal and
private; one would write for oneself, or, in Habermas¡¯s
formulation, one would make oneself public to oneself. By
making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became
an object for self-inspection and self-critique.
